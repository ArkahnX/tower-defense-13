To add a function to the rendering loop:
append it to the end of the animate() function.

any additional initialization to be done before the draw loop (loading sprites, etc):
place before the animate function is called in the event listener in draw.js

For now main variables are located in draw.js


using requirejs for build system. Prerequisites: npm install requirejs
